# Pong_Unity

The game contains two paddles and a ball. A ball is initially set in the middle and then with 'Enter' as an input, and it moves in the respective direction till collides with the paddles or the borders.

The paddle has to hit the ball if fails to hit it, will result in score for the other player.

The limit in this is set to '2' as whoever scores more than '2' points will win the game.And then the player is asked if they want to play again.
